mdzk is a plain text Zettelkasten system that works as the backend to your connected notes. It can take any folder of Markdown-files and process it into a directed graph that you can use to produce rich workflows, integrate with your favorite static site generator, host a language server and much more.

**MDZK IS CURRENTLY UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT,** which makes it somewhat unusable at the moment. If you are feeling adventurous, you can clone the repo and dive int the code yourself to see what we are up to. If you just want a usable static site generator for your Zettelkasten, consider downloading the previous generation [mdzk 0.5.2](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/releases/tag/0.5.2).
