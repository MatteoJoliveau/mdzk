# Documentation

**mdzk** is a plain text Zettelkasten system that works as the backend to your connected notes. It can take any folder of Markdown-files and process it into a directed graph that you can use to produce rich workflows, integrate with your favorite static site generator, host a language server and much more.

# Installing {#installing}

You can install mdzk from multiple package managers:

|Â Source |Â Installation command |
| -------------- | -------------------: |
|Â [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mdzk/) (with [Paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru)) | `paru -S mdzk` |
|Â [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/mdzk) | `cargo install mdzk` |
|Â [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mdzk#default) | `brew install mdzk` |
|Â [Nix](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=mdzk&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=mdzk) | `nix run nixpkgs#mdzk -- <command>` |

There is also a range of pre-built binaries available through the [release page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk/releases).

## Build mdzk yourself

If you want the latest and greatest, you can build mdzk from scratch by cloning the repo and building using [Rust tooling](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mdzk-rs/mdzk.git
$ cd mdzk
$ cargo build --release
```

An mdzk binary for your system will now be available in `./target/release`.

# Getting started {#getting-started}

In mdzk, a Zettelkasten is simply a directory containing two things: Some Markdown-files and a TOML configuration file. To simplify things, we'll make a new noun and refer to this directory (and it's output) as "your *mdzk*".

This getting started guide will go over setting up your own mdzk, adding notes to it and generating a static webpage from them.

## Initializing your mdzk

First, navigate to the directory you want to use as your mdzk and run

    $ mdzk init

Optionally, you can have mdzk create a new directory for you, by running `mdzk init <path>`. You will notice that the following has been generated:

- A TOML configuration file at the root of your mdzk, called `mdzk.toml`.

    > ðŸ“– *This file is used to specify metadata about your mdzk, build instructions and much more. You can read more about configuring [[Configuration|here]].*

- A directory called `notes`.

    > ðŸ“– *This is where you put all your notes (duh). If you want, you can change which path (relative to the root) holds your source notes by changing the `src` value in `mdzk.toml`.*

- A `.gitignore` file.

There are no notes in your mdzk yet, so nothing exciting will happen. This is your time to shine - let's write some content!

<!-- TODO: Adding existing notes -->

## Writing notes

Now is the time to open the `notes` folder in your favorite text editor. Start by creating some Markdown-files (`.md`) and write whatever your heart desires. Create some subdirectories if you want, and put notes in there. *Go buck wild!* If you have a collection of Markdown-notes already, this is the time to copy them over.

All notes follow an extended variant of the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) specification. An excellent overview of all it's features is available [here](https://commonmark.org/help/). If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, we recommend you follow [this quick interactive tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) to get comfortable with the markup language.

Among the main extensions mdzk provides to CommonMark are internal links. Internal links are made using the *wikilink* syntax, e.g.: `[[Name of destination note]]`. Say you have a note called `White bellbird's mating call.md`. If you want to make a link to this note from another, you can write

```markdown
I'm trying to pay attention and write notes from this lecture, but I'm too bored. I'd rather listen to a [[White bellbird's mating call]] than suffer another second.
```

This will create a link in the text and insert a backlink at the end of `White bellbird's mating call.md`. Note that the `.md` extension is excluded in internal links. More about mdzk's markup can be read [[Markup|here]].

> ðŸ“– *For a fully specialized experience, our text editor recommendation goes to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). mdzk is targeted specifically at it's syntax and is inspired by many of it's conventions. However, any text editor will suffice. I personally love writing my notes in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and there are many extensions that add wikilink support to e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Use whatever suits you best.*

## Building a static site

After you've added some notes, simply run

    $ mdzk build

to generate a static website. By default, everything is generated in the `html` directory at the root of your mdzk. This site is viewable locally by opening any of the generated HTML files, or it can be hosted on any static publishing platform - like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

mdzk also provides a webserver, so you can view your notes with live updating as you change them. To serve your mdzk locally, run:

    $ mdzk serve

Your notes are now available at <http://localhost:3000>.
